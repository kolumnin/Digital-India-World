0="null" was discovered in India and "1", the "advaitha" too. Yet, why currently everything falls and fails under lottery? If respect for 0 and 1 is weakened, the digital e-world becomes a useless delusion!
If the nation is digitised, each individual has unique digital value. So must be each instrument associated with an individual.

If we, together with the technology network we have built so far, can not manage the individual hunan being digitally ensuring peace, wellbeing, happiness and a healthy life, how do we manage the numerous other species living on the Earth without conflicts?
